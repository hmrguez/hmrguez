ðŸ¤™ I'm a gamer DUH! and an anime fan

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on my 2nd year project: A model of a Domino game to practice inheritance and generics

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning *C#* as a programming language, but also learning *Haskell* and *Java* as fallback languages, also learning Unity, how to draw and pretty much every skill I can find to fullfill my âœ¨dreamsâœ¨

â€» I'm very interested in the whole game development industry and working to become a profesional game developer â€»

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate with *Gabe Newell*. he is a truly inspiring person, for everything he's done to the gaming community he has my respect

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You should't pervert! But if you insist, go for [my email](d0t42f4n@gmail.com)

ðŸ¤” I'm very intrigued with the functional programming paradigm and willing to accept any help in the subject, as well as any help concerning game development tips and tricks

âš¡ Fun fact(s): My favorite game is *Dota 2* and I've been wanting to become a game developer since I was 8
